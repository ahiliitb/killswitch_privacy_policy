    <h1>KillSwitch – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 18 December 2025</p>

    <p>KillSwitch is a digital wellbeing app that helps reduce screen time by monitoring app usage and blocking distracting apps. This app is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13, to help manage device usage.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>KillSwitch does <strong>not</strong> require an account and does not collect personal information like names, emails, or phone numbers.</p>

    <p>To provide functionality, the app processes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Installed apps and package names</strong> – to let you select apps to monitor or block</li>
        <li><strong>App usage statistics</strong> – which apps you use and for how long (processed on your device only)</li>
        <li><strong>Screen text content</strong> – we use accessibility services to read screen content, but <strong>only for Google Chrome and YouTube apps</strong>. Screen reading is not performed for any other applications</li>
        <li><strong>App settings and preferences</strong> – stored locally on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Screen Reading (Accessibility Service)</h2>

    <p>KillSwitch uses Android's accessibility service to read screen content, but <strong>only for Google Chrome and YouTube applications</strong>. This helps provide app blocking functionality specifically for these two apps. Screen reading is <strong>not</strong> performed for any other applications on your device. All screen content is processed locally on your device and is <strong>not</strong> sent to any external services.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>No personal information is collected or stored. For YouTube and Chrome apps only, screen content may be sent to OpenAI's GPT API to classify content. All other data is stored <strong>on your device</strong> only. We do not maintain cloud servers. You can delete all data by clearing app data in system settings or uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

    <p>KillSwitch is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13, to help reduce screen time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information from children</li>
        <li>No personal information is collected or stored</li>
        <li>For YouTube and Chrome apps only, screen content may be sent to OpenAI's GPT API for content classification</li>
        <li>All other data processing happens on-device only</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell data or use it for advertising</li>
        <li>Parents/guardians can control permissions and delete data at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are a parent/guardian and have concerns, please contact us using the email on the app's store page.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Controls</h2>

    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grant or revoke permissions (including accessibility service) in device settings</li>
        <li>Configure which apps are monitored or blocked</li>
        <li>Clear app data or uninstall to delete all information</li>
    </ul>
