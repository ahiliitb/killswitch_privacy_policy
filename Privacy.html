    <h1>KillSwitch – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 18 December 2025</p>

    <p>KillSwitch is a digital wellbeing app that helps reduce screen time by monitoring app usage and blocking distracting apps. This app is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13, to help manage device usage.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>KillSwitch does <strong>not</strong> require an account and does not collect personal information like names, emails, or phone numbers.</p>

    <p>To provide functionality, the app processes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Installed apps and package names</strong> – to let you select apps to monitor or block</li>
        <li><strong>App usage statistics</strong> – which apps you use and for how long (processed on your device only)</li>
        <li><strong>Screen text content</strong> – if you enable AI features, we read on-screen text to classify content as distracting or productive</li>
        <li><strong>App settings and preferences</strong> – stored locally on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party AI Service (OpenAI)</h2>

    <p>If you enable AI features, the app sends <strong>screen text snippets</strong> and <strong>app names</strong> to OpenAI's API to classify content. We do <strong>not</strong> send your name, device ID, or contact information. Data is sent over encrypted HTTPS connections.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>All data is stored <strong>on your device</strong> only. We do not maintain cloud servers. When using AI features, data is temporarily sent to OpenAI for classification. You can delete all data by clearing app data in system settings or uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

    <p>KillSwitch is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13, to help reduce screen time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information from children</li>
        <li>All data processing happens on-device or is limited to necessary AI classification</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell data or use it for advertising</li>
        <li>Parents/guardians can control permissions and delete data at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are a parent/guardian and have concerns, please contact us using the email on the app's store page.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Controls</h2>

    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grant or revoke permissions in device settings</li>
        <li>Enable or disable AI features</li>
        <li>Configure which apps are monitored or blocked</li>
        <li>Clear app data or uninstall to delete all information</li>
    </ul>
